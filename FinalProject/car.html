			<h1>Diplomat Hotel, Baguio<hr></h1>
			<img src="Images/car.png" id="loc">
			<p>The town is thick with a ghostly mist from all its haunted spots. One of the most infamous is the Diplomat Hotel, built in 1913 and now a national historical site.
			However, just like many that have survived a century of colonization and wars, its rich history is far from a fairy tale. During World War II, the building was heavily blemished with the blood and misery of women raped, prisoners tortured, and nuns and priests decapitated. So when you visit the abandoned hotel, be ready to encounter headless ghosts, desperate cries, and physical disturbances.</p>
