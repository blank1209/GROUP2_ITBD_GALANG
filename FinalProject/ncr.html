			<h1>Manila Film Center, CCP Complex â€“ Pasay City</h1>
			<img src="Images/ncr.png" id="loc" style="width:370px;">
			<p>Among this list of scariest places in the Philippines, Manila Film Center is by far the newest. This Parthenon-inspired building is infamous for being a project of then-First Lady Imelda Marcos, as a venue for the 1982 Manila International Film Festival. Amid rushed construction, a portion of the upper floor collapsed, leaving an unknown number of workers buried in wet cement. 
			Up to this day, allegations remain that the bodies were dismissively paved over, in order to meet the deadline. After all, this building was meant to impress foreign guests. So, is it even a surprise that there are visitors who claim to have heard wailing sounds and screams of suffering, possibly from the workmen buried alive.</p>
