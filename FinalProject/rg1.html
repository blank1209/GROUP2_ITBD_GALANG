			<p>"After I took my own photo inside that ruins, the tricycle driver who drove me there told me that people around the area are seeing a priest inside that ruin without a head (pugot) and a lady dressed in white with a face that is hard to recognize. My body hairs got stiff and I told the driver, 'Kuya please paki-bilisan, umalis na tayo rito.' I didn't tell the driver about my experience there but the moment he told me about those ghost stories, I knew by myself that the glitches of my camera were not of human error."</p>
