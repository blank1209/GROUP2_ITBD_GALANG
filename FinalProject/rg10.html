			<h1>Dakbayan Haunted Apartment</h1>
			<img src="Images/rg10.png" id="loc" style="width:300px">
			<p>Between 1986 and 1988, a man and his wife stayed in an undisclosed apartment building in Cagayan de Oro. While relocating, they were told by their neighbors of childrenâ€™s laughter and their musical toys playing ringing out from their new place.

			He was told by his co-worker, both a mananambal and a medium, that there was once a balete tree standing where the apartment now stood. When it was cut down, a whole community of elementals who once lived in the tree was displaced.
			Sometimes, there is a big black sow that would visit them in the night. But whenever the man opens the door to shoo it away, it disappears, and no one else from his neighborhood ever saw it.

			Other than the black sow, it was of the little brown beings that he was scared the most. These beings would play in their laundry area when no one was at home. Neighbors would claim to hear sounds of a basin being rolled around. One time, when someone peeked through a window to check what was causing the sounds, one of the little brown men who looked like a gremlin or a troll stopped and looked straight at them!

			Suffice to say, whenever the man and his wife hears strange noises in their apartment at night, they never investigated, even out of curiosity.
