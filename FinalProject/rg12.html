			<p>An unsettling occurrence sent shivers down the spines of all who witnessed it. Twelve prison inmates, confined behind its foreboding walls, found themselves entangled in a sinister web of the supernatural. Possessed by an evil spirit that defied rational explanation, these captives became unwitting vessels for a malevolent force that roamed the corridors and tormented their very souls. Some speculate that it is an effect cause of drugs. But to some religious indivuals, they believe that it was the devil itself that mentally tortures the inmates.
