			<p>Considered as the tallest single-drop waterfall in the province, Dum-liing falls cascades like a roaring tiger for more than 98 meters. It drops on the face of a massive cliff towards massive boulders that are visible from afar.

			According to a local legend, spirits used to live here, however, an earthquake caused them to disappear. The native inhabitants also share that the waterfall was much higher in the past but raging waters and landslides upstream caused its gradual degradation. But it remains a breathtaking sight beyond compare.</p>
