			<h1>Mount San Cristobal – Laguna and ‎Quezon<hr></h1>
			<img src="Images/rg4.png" id="loc">
			<p>Mount San Cristobal is a dormant volcano that sits between the borders of San Pablo, Laguna and Dolores, Quezon. It’s also right next to the more popular Mount Banahaw, which some Filipinos consider a sacred place. However, Mount San Cristobal is believed to be the exact opposite, with its eerie moniker as the ‘Devil’s Mountain.’ 
			
			Legend has it that Mount San Cristobal is home to malevolent spirits, as well as a mythological creature that locals call the Tumao, sort of like a local version of a Sasquatch (or Bigfoot). Other chill-inducing tales range from disappearance of mountaineers, to those falling to their deaths after following the voices of ‘children.’ It has been closed indefinitely since 2016.</p>
