			<h1>Ghost of Bicol University CS Building 2<hr></h1>
			<img src="Images/rg5.png" id="loc">
			<p>A female ghost, about 18 to 20 years old, is said to be roaming around Building 2 of the College of Science. According to stories, there are times when she can be seen passing by the washroom’s mirror, sitting in classes, or just hanging out at the computer laboratory.

			An encounter between this lady ghost and a student supposedly happened recently. An IT freshman was busy programming in a make-up class on the opening day of BU Week when her computer suddenly shut down, even though there was no power interruption that day. Her professor saw her and told her to just continue working on her task, and offered his computer.

			After class, her professor told her why he let her use his computer. He said that earlier, he saw a woman standing beside her. “Yung babaeng nakatayo sa likod mo, pinatay ‘yung computer mo (The woman behind you turned off your computer),” he said.</p>
