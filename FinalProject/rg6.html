			<h1>Patag Hospital<hr></h1>
			<img src="Images/rg6.png" id="loc" style="width:330px">
			<p>The reputation of Patag Hospital comes from the tragic events that have occurred in the battle of Patag. The hospital was the last stand of the Japanese forces during the war. The area was haunted with blood, terrifying screams, painful tears, and horrible stories for those who survived. Some locals would sometimes see and hear Japanese soldiers in torn clothes mumbling in their own language. The waterfall near the camping site was also named “Pulang Tubig” (Red Water) because it was where the blood of the Japanese soldiers streamed. Nowadays, the building serves as a backpackers’ lodge.</p>
