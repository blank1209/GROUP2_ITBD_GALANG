			<h1>Old Enchanted Balete Tree – Lazi, Siquijor<hr></h1>
			<img src="Images/rg7.png" id="loc" style="width:320px;">
			<p>Through the years, the island of Siquijor has had quite the rep for being one of the ‘scariest’ places in the Philippines. This usually stems from its air of mysticism and mystery, which all the more attracts travellers. In fact, some inhabitants are said to shamans and sorcerers.
			Among its famous attractions is the 500-year-old balete tree in the town of Lazi. Not only is it the oldest and largest one in Siquijor, but it’s also believed to be the home of supernatural creatures like the diwata, dwende, kapre, and engkanto. What’s more, you’ll find a natural spring flowing from underneath the tree into the man-made pool. Though, the exact source of the water remains unknown!</p>
			
			<h1>Casa Gorordo Museum – Cebu City<hr></h1>
			<img src="Images/rg72.png" id="loc">
			<p>Casa Gorordo used to be the residence of Juan Gorordo, a.k.a. the first Filipino bishop in the country. He died in the master’s bedroom sometime in December 1934. Now, the manor serves as a historical landmark and museum, showcasing the lifestyle of wealthy Cebuanos during the Spanish period. 
			Through the years, there have been accounts from both staff and visitors seeing apparitions. And no, it’s not the ghost of the Bishop but rather, one of his sisters. Having died a spinster, she is said to be sitting at the courtship area of the house, in front of the private chapel.</p>
