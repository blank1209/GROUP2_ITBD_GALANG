			<h1>Casa Mariquit - Iloilo City<hr></h1>
			<img src="Images/rg8.png" id="loc">
			<p>Some souls have found rest. Some wander in areas where they were killed. Casa Mariquit in Jaro reflects Iloilo’s glorious past. However, this 200-year-old residence was built for Maria Mariquit Javellana-Lopez, the wife of former Vice President Fernando Lopez Sr. also houses eerie stories that’ll surely have your hair raising on its ends. During WWII, Japanese forces were believed to have used the house library as a torture chamber. There is also a tunnel that leads to the Old Jaro Belfry and was used by the Japanese as a secret hideout. Caretakers of this old house despise visitors from visiting it at 7 PM. Also, they inform guests that no one sleeps inside the house anymore because the last person who stayed the night awoke lying on a wooden bench rather than the bed. In one incident, a tourist’s friend decided to look at the pictures she took with her phone once they were in the van. She was the one who noticed something strange about the grotto image-Something small and blue was apparently sitting cross-legged at the top of the grotto. If you’re up for a nerve-racking horror experience, why not try staying the night? Who knows what your overnight stay might have in store?.</p>
