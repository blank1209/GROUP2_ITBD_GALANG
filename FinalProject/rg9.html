			<h1>Moncado White Mansion — Brgy. Limao, Island Garden City of Samal<hr></h1>
			<img src="Images/rg9.png" id="loc" style="width:320px">
			<p>I remember visiting the abandoned white mansion when I was younger while on vacation with my family. It was in the middle of a vast land property and had a majestic view of the Davao Gulf. The mansion was owned by late Filipino mystic and activist General Hilario Camino Moncado. It was also said to be the headquarters of the Moncadistas, a religious sect founded by the late general.

			The White House village was branded as the most haunted place in the Philippines by the Davao Paranormal Society (DPS) after a paranormal investigation was conducted in the said mansion. The DPS claims that there are “active spirits” of both Filipino and foreign nationalities residing in the mansion. The mansion’s caretaker also attests to the presence of a white lady and a man dragging a ball and chain in the area.</p>
